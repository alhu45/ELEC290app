The purpose of the code is to create an app that receives a bluetooth signal from an Arduino, reads the data, and sends a push notification back to the user. This was all done inside of Android studio. 

The MainActivity.java file contains the files where the bluetooth signal is received from the Arduino. The notification.java file sends the notification back to the user.
